# CableGuardian
Rotation (yaw) tracker for VR headsets  
     - supported APIs: OculusVR, OpenVR  
     - tested with Oculus Rift, but should be compatible with all OpenVR (SteamVR) headsets such as HTC Vive

The purpose of the application is to prevent excessive twisting of the headset cable and thus:  
     - improve the lifetime of the cable  
     - improve the VR experience as you don't have to:  
          - actively monitor your turning direction during gameplay  
          - peek for orientation  
          - remove the headset to straighten out the cable  

Cable Guardian uses customizable audio notifications, featuring:   
    - audio device selection  
    - a simple mixer for pan and volume  
    - editable trigger points and rules  
    - support for custom sounds (by copying wave (*.wav) files to the executable directory)  
    - user profiles  

Cable Guardian runs in the background with minimal CPU usage and doesn't render anything on the HMD.
