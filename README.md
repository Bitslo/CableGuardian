# CableGuardian
Rotation (yaw) tracker for VR headsets  
     - supported APIs: OculusVR, OpenVR  
     - tested with Oculus Rift, but should be compatible with all OpenVR (SteamVR) headsets such as HTC Vive

The purpose of the application is to monitor your rotations in VR and thus:  
     - improve the lifetime of the cable by preventing excessive twisting  
     - improve the VR experience as you don't have to actively monitor your turning direction or peek for orientation
     - eliminate the need to take off your headset just to straighten out the cable

Cable Guardian uses customizable audio notifications, featuring:   
     - audio device selection  
     - a simple mixer for pan and volume  
     - editable trigger points and rules  
     - support for custom sounds (by copying wave (*.wav) files to the executable directory)  
     - user profiles  
    
In version 1.1.0 a lazy man's alarm clock was added to further increase immersion as there will be no need to check on time.  
     - quicker to set up than the timer on a cell phone or Windows  
     - alarm will sound inside the headset

Cable Guardian runs in the background with minimal CPU usage and doesn't render anything on the HMD.
