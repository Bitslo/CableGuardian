# CableGuardian
Rotation (yaw) tracker for VR headsets  
     - supported APIs: OculusVR, OpenVR (SteamVR)       
     - tested with the Oculus Rift and the Valve Index. Should be compatible with other Oculus and OpenVR headsets as well (e.g. Oculus Rift S and HTC Vive)

The purpose of the application is to monitor your rotations in VR and thus:  
     - improve the lifetime of the cable by preventing excessive twisting  
     - improve the VR experience as you don't have to actively monitor your turning direction or peek for orientation  
     - eliminate the need to take off your headset just to straighten out the cable

Cable Guardian uses customizable audio notifications, featuring:   
     - audio device selection  
     - a simple mixer for pan and volume  
     - editable trigger points and rules  
     - support for custom sounds (by copying wave (*.wav) files to the executable directory)  
     - user profiles  
    
In version 1.1.0 a lazy man's alarm clock was added to further increase immersion as there will be no need to check on time.  
     - quicker to set up than the timer on a cell phone or Windows  
     - alarm will sound inside the headset

Cable Guardian runs in the background with minimal CPU usage and doesn't render anything on the HMD.
